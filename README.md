## 4 player ping pong game written in p5.js. [Try it out](https://tejas1794.github.io/FourPaddles/).
Created by learning from [The Coding Train Coding Challenge 67](https://youtu.be/IIrC5Qcb2G4). 
See their implementation in their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/CodingChallenges).

## Objective:
The ball generates towards a random angle from the center during the start of each cycle. Each player uses a paddle to hit the ball and make it go out of bounds to get a point. Final objective of the game is to score as many points as possible.

- No point changes if ball hasn't been hit by a paddle during current cycle.
- First player to get **10** points wins.

## Controls (for now):
_Top_ paddle: **R**, **T**

_Right_ paddle: **K**, **M**

_Bottom_ paddle: **V**, **B**

_Left_ paddle: **A**, **Z**
